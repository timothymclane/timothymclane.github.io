Visual Studio Code is designed to be incredibly extensible, and Microsoft has provided some great tooling for getting started with developing extensions. I&#8217;ve been wanting some snippets for React-Redux development that use the ES6 arrow function syntax, so I decided to build out a little VS Code extension so I could have them both at home and at work.

Here&#8217;s an example of the container snippet. (If the image doesn&#8217;t scale properly, here&#8217;s a [direct link](https://github.com/timothymclane/vscode-react-redux-snippets/raw/master/images/container.gif).)

The extension is published on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timothymclane.react-redux-es6-snippets), and can be installed in Code by searching for React Redux ES6 Snippets. Please let me know if you run into any issues or think the snippets could be improved in any way.

The source code is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/timothymclane/vscode-react-redux-snippets). As this is my first extension, I welcome any comments or contributions, either here or on my GitHub.
