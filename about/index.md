Hi! My name is Timothy McLane, but most folks call me Tim. My day-job consists mostly of .NET and TypeScript + React development (with a little F# when I can squeeze it in), though by night I am a functional reactive programming enthusiast. I'm passionate about pure fun(ctions) and I love all things reactive and functional.

# What I Write About
My posts mostly cover my side-hacking and projects I work on in my spare time, though occasionally I will post a presentation I have given. My goal is to share the little nuggets of knowledge I find along my way and hopefully help others get excited about software development, particularly in regard to functional programming. Thanks for stopping by!
